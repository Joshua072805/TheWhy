        <h2>WHO CREATED GOD?</h2>
        <p>"In the first book of the Bible, God is described as the beginning and the one who created everything. We can read this in Genesis 1:1, “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” and further towards Genesis 1:3, “And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light.”This means that God is the start of everything, and this also means that before God made the heavens and the earth, he already existed.While we do not know what happened before God created our surroundings, we know that he exists beyond time. Time is irrelevant for God because he invented time itself.Abraham knew the nature of our eternal God in Genesis 21:33, “Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.” Abraham’s acknowledgment of God’s eternal nature can inspire us to do the same.If we understand fully that God is eternal and beyond time, we can fathom his greatness and be assured that he can do anything, even pass judgment on time. Our time today may be short or fast, yet it is irrelevant for God because he is eternal." -Glory Dy </p>
        
        <p>God is the creator of the universe, that's why he is outside the universe, us creations are indeed limited by inside the created. This question assume God is affected by time, that God has a beginning but as established God is eternal, means of without a beginning and of an End. He is the uncaused cause, He is the first cause of everything that set the universe in motion, Science also theorized that the world must have a beginning, the creation.</p>
