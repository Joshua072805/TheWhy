        <h2>DO GOD EXIST?</h2>
        <p>Before proving  benevolence of God we must first establish a foundation using our rationality and logic that God exist. According to Saint Thomas Aquinas there's an uncaused caused, which is the cause of everything. "Nature of the efficient cause. In the world of sense we find there is an order of efficient causes. There is no case known (neither is it, indeed, possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause, whether the intermediate cause be several, or only one. Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first efficient cause, to which everyone gives the name of God." </p>
        
        <p>You see, nothing is caused by itself, the common refutation that I see is why call it a God? Can't it be just a fluke somewhere? why can't it be just a big bang. First it assumes that the first caused is within our natural world, if something is the start of everything logically speaking it should be outside of everything which is something supernatural. wither you call it a God or not It is something beyond our universe. </p>
        
        <p> The uncaused caused argument is by itself sufficient to prove that there's something beyond, but to add there can't be also anything be called good or bad in the world without God, where would you based your morals? Skeptics always reject the premise of Objective morality for that matter, but it can't be true as they themselves also acknowledge the common good but why? Why would be there a common good if your definition of good is subjective? It may good for you bu not many but there's common good and everyone knows that some things are just evil and something are just good, no one will argue that Murder is sometimes good but everyone knows its Bad why? who said that maybe the law but even without the Law. In conclusion we can't know everything in our world but to deny a simple fact about our world is fooliss, to be rational is good but you should be also be at the evidence.</p>
